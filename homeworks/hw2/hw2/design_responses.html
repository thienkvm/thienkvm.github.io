							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that white space is a crucial topic in order to effectively balance out designs. I also learned that negative space is also called white space! I also realized that the act of scrolling in the newer generation is being noted by designers. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part about this article was the debunking of white space and its focus on how to use it more efficiently.The article tackles the effect of white space and emphasizes its importance, which is something that isn't mentioned as much! It's nice to see acknowledgment of something that generally isnt considered "design."</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "White space is not wasted space." </p>
