                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned that for the most part, playing around with colors allows for greater contrast between frames. Using animations is also a way to differentiate a timeline from websites! Most interactions create more complex actions in order to keeo users entertained, but not too complex to confuse users.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>  My favorite part of this article is the number of diverse frames they included. Each of the frames displayed a dynamic way of movement, which was nice to see. Not only that, but the differences between each usage of animations per type of work associated was super interesting to see as well! </p>

                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>  I really liked the "Works transitioned" page animation as well as the "AI powered Assistant." The "Works Transitoned" page was just super cool to see how animations can lead one page to another. On the "AI Assistant" inspiration, I just thought the color scheme and transitons seemed smooth. Both inspirations were extremely mind-opening to look at!</p>

                            <p>8; I was expecting a written article to read through, but looking at visual examples helps stimulate my brain a lot better with these examples.</p>
